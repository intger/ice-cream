# Ice-Cream Landing Page

Wordpress Theme for a landing page with some multi-part form that posts data to Hubspot and a nice design. Backend was managed with ACF, and the frontend for the landing page is custom built with Bootstrap, SCSS and Vanilla Javascript. On top of that, there's a webpack config that compiles and minifies all scripts and styles. 

P.S ( Webpack is not a complete configuration but just a basic one, since for this project it wasn't even a requirement )


## Development Environment
You don't need to do much to get started:  

```
npm install
npm run watch
```
And there you go, that's it. 

### Extra Info
By just cloning the theme you will still not have a working product, because you will be missing the ACF backend. Though hardcoding the text values on the theme can help with that and you'll see the same result.
